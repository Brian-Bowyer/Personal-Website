                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>I'm Brian, and I'm a software developer who really likes to learn new things. 
                    I currently do data analysis for Reimbursement Genie, a company that manages reimbursements for Amazon sellers. 
                    At work, I use mainly Python, Pandas, and SQL, though I have worked with Flask in the past.</p>
                <p>I also have done a variety of personal projects, such as this website, written primarily in Flask. Check them out on the <a href="{{url_for('projects')}}">Projects</a> page in the top bar (or you could just click that link).</p>
                <p>When I'm not coding, I play lots of tabletop RPGs (such as, but not limited to, Dungeons and Dragons).
                    I also enjoy board games such as Terraforming Mars and grand strategy games such as Stellaris.
